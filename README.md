# JPG to PDF converter

Python script to convert a folder of images to combine all of then in a single file.

You can use it to combine the images of your class notes, your manga volumes or whatever you want.

## How does it works?

To explain this, I will use as an example a manhwa chapter that I have in images:

### 1. Clone the repository on your computer

### 2. Locate the folder in which the images to be converted to pdf are located and copy the path (It is important that this folder only contains images) 

### 3. Run the program with your favorite IDE

### 4. Enter the path, previously copied, of the images to be converted

### 5. Enter the name of the pdf
